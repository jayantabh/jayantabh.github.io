## **Personal Bio**

### **Interests:** 
Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing

### **Certifications:**
#### [**1. Deep Learning Specialization:**](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/TUC5PDD83AYS)
Deep Learning Specialization was an experience which made me think how a concept which is ubiquitous in the technology space can be so simple to implement. Taught by the highly revered professor, Andrew NG, it break down seemingly vast concepts in Deep Learning into simple terms, building these concepts from ground-up. Augmented with several real-life projects on topics covered, this specialization fits perfectly after Andrew's Machine Learning course for anyone interested in Neural Networks. 

Courses: 
* Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Structuring Machine Learning Projects
* Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Sequence Models

Relevant Projects:
* Car Detection using YOLOv2
